Other Notes

general CS audience: ACM CACM: https://cacm.acm.org/ - <4,000 words, incl. 1,000 words for sidebar(s), a simple example of syntax, who’s using it, directions for future expansion (what’s going to happen and why)

Manuscripts should not exceed eight template pages, including any tables, graphics, or figures. Inclusions of such elements is encouraged to improve readability. References are not included in the eight pages. https://cacm.acm.org/about-communications/author-center/author-guidelines#2.3.4

Audience (CACM readers)

- Large systems architects
- One of the top business process researcher and consultant
- Head of CERN or other ESFRI / S3 project
- Lead engineers

Desired outcomes

- Advertisement of CWL in a way that is recognizable for those with similar problems
- Introduction to the benefits of workflow approaches, if not already know (via sidebar)
- Understanding of the breadth of technical benefits
- Understanding of the community ecosystem benefits
- Know that CWL standards are the product of an open and free standards making community
