Large numbers of jobs are executed at regular intervals to process new data and generate new forecasts.

Cylc ("Silk") (1)(2)(3) is designed to manage infinite cycling workflows efficiently even after delays in real-time operation, or in historical runs, when cycles can typically interleave for much-increased throughput. Cylc is not actually specialized to environmental forecasting, however, and cycling workflows may also be useful in other contexts. In this article we describe the origins and major features of Cylc, future plans for the project, and our experience of Open Source development and community engagement.},

That is why this Plan lists the ambitions and provides details of the parties intending to take action, as well as the timeframes within which they believe they can realise their objectives. The key ambitions are: (1) Full open access to publications in 2020: Continue the Dutch approach for all Dutch research organisations and research areas whilst recognising their differences and similarities; (2) To make research data optimally suited for reuse: To set clear and agreed technical and policy-related preconditions to facilitate reuse of research data, including provision of the necessary expertise and support; (3) Recognition and rewards: To examine together how open science can be an element of the evaluation and reward system for researchers, research groups and research proposals; and (4) To promote and support: To establish a 'clearing house' for all information regarding all available research support. With the ambitions set out in this plan the Netherlands is responding to the Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science published in 2016, the conclusions of the Competitiveness Council in May 2016, and to the in the letter to Parliament concerning open science confirmed question by the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science (January 2017).

The initial stage of bioinfor-matic analysis generally involves the identification of phylogenetic markers such as ribosomal RNA genes. The sequencing reads that do not code for rRNA can then be used for protein-based analysis. Hidden Markov model is a well-known method for pattern recognition. Hidden Markov models that are trained on well-curated rRNA sequence databases have been successfully used to identify DNA sequence coding for rRNAs in pro-karyotes. Here, we introduce rRNASelector, which is a computer program for selecting rRNA genes from massive metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences using hidden Markov models. The program successfully identified prokaryotic 5S, 26S, and 23S rRNA genes from Roche 454 FLX Titanium-based metagenomic and metatranscriptomic libraries.

	abstract = {As part of the COVID-19 Virtual Biohackathon 2020 we formed a working group to create a
COVID-19 Public Sequence Resource (COVID-19 PubSeq) for SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences. Our goal
was to create a repository that had a low barrier to entry for uploading and analyzing sequence
data. We followed FAIR data practices: data are published with public domain (CC0) or creative
commons 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0) license, structured metadata is validated against standard ontologies,
and, most importantly, reproducible workflows are executed after the upload in order to provide
up-to-date results rapidly and in standardized data formats.

Existing data repositories for viral data include GISAID, EBI ENA and NCBI. These repositories allow
for free sharing data, but do not enforce strict quality control on submitted data or metadata, and
do not add value in terms of running additional analysis. In addition, some databases have a
restricted license which prevents data from being used in online web services and on-the-fly
computation, hindering research.

We created a prototype sequence resource within one week by leveraging existing technologies,
such as the Arvados Cloud platform (http://arvados.org), Common Workflow Language (CWL)
(http://commonwl.org), and the many free and open source software packages that are available
for bioinformatics. Pipelines developed by several teams were combined into an omnibus
pangenome analysis workflow. Computing resources for this project were generously donated by
Amazon Web Services.},

It is easy to assume computational methods self-document by their very nature of being exact, deterministic processes.

These two aspects of computational reproducibility (workflows and execution details) are discussed in the context of biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (bioNMR) as well as the PRIMAD model for computational reproducibility.},

	abstract = {As the demand for Cloud computing trends up, valuable datasets are stored in the Cloud across various geographical regions and Cloud platforms and providers. The distribution of data across cloud providers imposes three major challenges for data-driven analysis and applications: the heterogeneity of cloud resources across clouds; low network throughput over the widearea network; and high monetary cost resulting from moving data in/out cloud regions. In this work we propose a cloudagnostic framework named PIVOT that builds on open-source technologies and abstraction principles to create the illusion of one single computer for applications and users. We have deployed a prototype across AWS and GCP and investigated its effectiveness against synthetic workloads. Using a combination of advanced middleware techniques and data-locality and cost aware scheduling strategies we show that PIVOT is able to achieve up to 4x improvement in network throughput and reduce {\textgreater} 60\% monetary cost.},

Traditional cluster computing frameworks can hardly cope with the unprecedented data volume and the geo-distributed, cross-cloud data distribution due to their limited scalability and adaptability across the heterogeneous clouds. Moreover, running data-intensive applications across clouds at will is extremely cost-inefﬁcient and likely to incur outrageous expenses. Hence, we introduce our cloud-agnostic system PIVOT with the novel cost-aware scheduling algorithm, which enables dataintensive applications to run and scale across clouds instantly in a cost-efﬁcient manner. We evaluate our system and scheduling algorithm extensively with simulation, and real-world big data applications on a deployment across 11 regions on AWS and GCP. The experimental results show that PIVOT achieves over 55\% saving in expense for VM subscription and up to 92\% for egress network trafﬁc compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the cost-aware scheduling also achieves up to a 10x speedup in data transfers for data-intensive applications.},

Some of those platforms and tools, typically available as open source products, are experiencing a very fast adoption in industry and science such that they are becoming “de facto” references in several areas of data engineering, data science and machine learning. In parallel to users' requests, WLCG is considering to consolidate its deployment model into a relatively reduced number of resource sites (while benefiting from potentially ephemeral resources like public cloud and large installations like experiment filter farms, HPC facilities, analysis centres).

	abstract = {MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource. Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the input data, and that are formally described using the Common Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their enriched annotations.},

	abstract = {The availability of a growing volume of environmental data from space represents a unique opportunity for science, general R\&D, and applications (apps), but it also poses a major challenge to achieve its full potential in terms of data exploitation. Firstly, because the emergence of large volumes of data (Petabytes era) raises new issues in terms of discovery, access, exploitation, and visualization of “Big Data”, with profound implications on how users do “data-intensive” Earth Science. Secondly, because the inherent growing diversity and complexity of data and users, whereby different communities – having different needs, skills, methods, languages and protocols – need to cooperate to make sense of a wealth of data of different nature (e.g. EO, in-situ, model), structure and format.

Responding to these technological and community challenges requires the development of new ways of working, capitalizing on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) developments to facilitate the exploitation, analysis, sharing, mining and visualization of massive EO data sets and high-level products within Europe and beyond. Evolution in information technology and the consequent shifts in user behavior and expectations provide new opportunities to provide more significant support to EO data exploitation.

Earth Observation Platforms provide customers with an environment allowing them to focus on their core business and outsource other aspects to a platform that supplies services to a large number of customers with similar needs. The success of platforms in the business world is based on their ability to minimize cost and time to market for their customers, thereby also reducing the risk of exploring unproven business cases. In recent years, Platforms for the Exploitation of Earth Observation data have been developed by public and private companies in order to foster the usage of EO data and expand the market of Earth Observation-derived information. The domain is composed of platform providers, service providers who use the platform to deliver a service to their users, and data providers. The availability of free and open data (e.g. Copernicus Sentinel), together with the availability of affordable computing resources, creates an opportunity for the wide adoption and use of Earth Observation data in a growing number of fields in our society.

OGC activities in Testbed-13, Testbed-14, and Testbed-15 initiated the development of an architecture to allow the ad-hoc deployment and execution of applications close to the physical location of the source data with the goal to minimize data transfer between data repositories and application processes.

The activity described in this Engineering Report responds to the invitation for Earth observation platform operators to implement the OGC Earth Observation Applications Pilot architecture as it has been defined in those previous OGC Innovation Program (IP) initiatives. The goal of the pilot is to evaluate the maturity of those specifications in a real-world environment with several Earth Observation applications brought by several application developers that work with Earth observation satellites. These developers brought different views and requirements in terms of data discovery, data loading, data processing, and result delivery to which the platform readiness is challenged and evolutions are proposed to the architecture.

This Engineering Report initiates by introducing the Earth Observation (EO) Platform architecture and documents the encoding and interfaces needed for defining, deployment and execution of EO Applications brought by the different application developers. The ER concludes with a summary of the main challenges found during the pilot activities and provides further recommendations to advance the architecture, integration and implementation strategies taking in consideration the viewpoints of both EO platforms and EO application developers.},

	abstract = {This Engineering Report (ER) summarizes the main achievements of the OGC Innovation Program initiative OGC Earth Observation Applications Pilot, conducted between December 2019 and July 2020. The pilot explored an Earth Observation Application software architecture that was developed in OGC Testbeds 13-15. The architecture allows the deployment and execution of externally developed applications on Earth Observation (EO) data and processing platforms. The architecture is essentially based on three major components:

    Execution Management Service (EMS): This component provides a RESTful interface (defined using OpenAPI) to register applications and build workflows from registered applications. The EMS selects the appropriate ADES platform to execute the processes based on the runtime input parameters (close to the data).

    Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES): This component allows deployment, discovery, and execution of applications or processing of quoting requests.

    Applications are delivered in the form of Docker images along with corresponding metadata called an Application Package (AP). The application package provides all information for deployment and execution of an application.

The pilot demonstrated that the interoperability arrangements developed and documented in OGC Innovation Program initiatives Testbed 13, 14 and 15 provide a solid starting point for maturity tests within operational platforms. Additional arrangements and more detailed definitions have been developed during the pilot that now allow deployment and execution of an application on various platforms with minimal adaptions.

The pilot produced very valuable results. It confirmed the general approach to use Docker for application packaging and HTTP Web APIs or Web Services for application handling and execution. It defined application patterns based on data inputs/outputs, confirmed the role of the Common Workflow Language (CWL) for application description, execution, and workflow building; and recommends the usage of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) as a data manifest for application inputs and outputs.},

	abstract = {CRIM’s key findings are as follows:

    From the application developer’s perspective, it was easier to first develop and test locally, and then use an OGC Application Programming Interface (API) to deploy and execute remotely. This is partly due to a smoother learning curve from application to packaging, than from package to platform.

    Conformance classes for an Application Deployment and Execution Service (ADES) API should be standardized. An offset in the support of API elements subsists in participants' implementations.

    Application packaging, deployment and execution are appropriately defined by combination of Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Docker images.

    More tests are required to better support application workflows running in multiple platforms. In order to build a federated cloud, these tests have to run regularly, in a structured and systemic fashion.

    Participants' findings should offer feedback into EOEPCA, for example for platforms intending to support machine learning (ML) services. From the application developer’s perspective, ML apps are well defined and should be deployable like any other app. It is not clear with the current EOEPCA use cases that the platforms will easily integrate ML services (annotations, trained models, access to GPU clusters, etc.).},

To enable this, individual tools are packaged within Docker containers and described by the Common Workflow Language (CWL), an emerging standard for enabling reproducible data analysis. On the CGC, researchers can deploy individual tools and customize massive workflows by chaining together tools.

	abstract = {Bioinformatics software tools are often created ad hoc, frequently by people without extensive training in software development. In particular, for beginners, the barrier to entry in bioinformatics software development is high, especially if they want to adopt good programming practices. Even experienced developers do not always follow best practices. This results in the proliferation of poorer-quality bioinformatics software, leading to limited scalability and inefficient use of resources; lack of reproducibility, usability, adaptability, and interoperability; and erroneous or inaccurate results.We have developed Bionitio, a tool that automates the process of starting new bioinformatics software projects following recommended best practices. With a single command, the user can create a new well-structured project in 1 of 12 programming languages. The resulting software is functional, carrying out a prototypical bioinformatics task, and thus serves as both a working example and a template for building new tools. Key features include command-line argument parsing, error handling, progress logging, defined exit status values, a test suite, a version number, standardized building and packaging, user documentation, code documentation, a standard open source software license, software revision control, and containerization.Bionitio serves as a learning aid for beginner-to-intermediate bioinformatics programmers and provides an excellent starting point for new projects. This helps developers adopt good programming practices from the beginning of a project and encourages high-quality tools to be developed more rapidly. This also benefits users because tools are more easily installed and consistent in their usage.

	abstract = {We have witnessed a surge in both the big data applications being hosted by an assortment of cloud vendors, and in the astronomical amount of data they produce and consume on a daily basis. Traditional cluster computing frameworks can hardly cope with the unprecedented data volume and the geo-distributed, cross-cloud data distribution due to their limited scalability and adaptability across the heterogeneous clouds. Moreover, running data-intensive applications across clouds at will is extremely cost-inefficient and likely to incur outrageous expenses. Hence, we introduce our cloud-agnostic system PIVOT with the novel cost-aware scheduling algorithm, which enables data-intensive applications to run and scale across clouds instantly in a cost-efficient manner. We evaluate our system and scheduling algorithm extensively with the Alibaba production cluster trace, as well as real-world big data applications on a 100-node deployment across 11 regions (31 availability zones) on AWS and GCP. The experimental results show that PIVOT achieves up to 90.8\% saving in expense for VM subscription and 99.2\% for egress network traffic compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the cost-aware scheduling also achieves over 4x speedup in data transfers for data-intensive applications.},

	abstract = {High-level programming languages such as Python are increasingly used to provide intuitive interfaces to libraries written in lower-level languages and for assembling applications from various components. This migration towards orchestration rather than implementation, coupled with the growing need for parallel computing (e.g., due to big data and the end of Moore's law), necessitates rethinking how parallelism is expressed in programs. Here, we present Parsl, a parallel scripting library that augments Python with simple, scalable, and flexible constructs for encoding parallelism. These constructs allow Parsl to construct a dynamic dependency graph of components that it can then execute efficiently on one or many processors. Parsl is designed for scalability, with an extensible set of executors tailored to different use cases, such as low-latency, high-throughput, or extreme-scale execution. We show, via experiments on the Blue Waters supercomputer, that Parsl executors can allow Python scripts to execute components with as little as 5 ms of overhead, scale to more than 250000 workers across more than 8000 nodes, and process upward of 1200 tasks per second. Other Parsl features simplify the construction and execution of composite programs by supporting elastic provisioning and scaling of infrastructure, fault-tolerant execution, and integrated wide-area data management. We show that these capabilities satisfy the needs of many-task, interactive, online, and machine learning applications in fields such as biology, cosmology, and materials science.},

	abstract = {Scientific workflows are a popular mechanism for specifying and automating data-driven in silico experiments. A significant aspect of their value lies in their potential to be reused. Once shared, workflows become useful building blocks that can be combined or modified for developing new experiments. However, previous studies have shown that storing workflow specifications alone is not sufficient to ensure that they can be successfully reused, without being able to understand what the workflows aim to achieve or to re-enact them. To gain an understanding of the workflow, and how it may be used and repurposed for their needs, scientists require access to additional resources such as annotations describing the workflow, datasets used and produced by the workflow, and provenance traces recording workflow executions. In this article, we present a novel approach to the preservation of scientific workflows through the application of research objects—aggregations of data and metadata that enrich the workflow specifications. Our approach is realised as a suite of ontologies that support the creation of workflow-centric research objects. Their design was guided by requirements elicited from previous empirical analyses of workflow decay and repair. The ontologies developed make use of and extend existing well known ontologies, namely the Object Reuse and Exchange (ORE) vocabulary, the Annotation Ontology (AO) and the W3C PROV ontology (PROVO). We illustrate the application of the ontologies for building Workflow Research Objects with a case-study that investigates Huntington’s disease, performed in collaboration with a team from the Leiden University Medial Centre (HG-LUMC). Finally we present a number of tools developed for creating and managing workflow-centric research objects.},

The PROV provenance model is deliberately generic and domain-agnostic, but extension mechanisms are available and can be exploited for modelling specific domains. This tutorial provides an account of these specifications. Starting from intuitive and informal examples that present idiomatic provenance patterns, it progressively introduces the relational model of provenance along with the constraints model for validation of provenance documents, and concludes with example applications that show the extension points in use.},

The fact that it is compact and readable and its complete set of scientific libraries are two important characteristics that favour its adoption. Nevertheless, Python still lacks a solution for easily parallelizing generic scripts on distributed infrastructures, since the current alternatives mostly require the use of APIs for message passing or are restricted to embarrassingly parallel computations. In that sense, this paper presents PyCOMPSs, a framework that facilitates the development of parallel computational workflows in Python. In this approach, the user programs her script in a sequential fashion and decorates the functions to be run as asynchronous parallel tasks. A runtime system is in charge of exploiting the inherent concurrency of the script, detecting the data dependencies between tasks and spawning them to the available resources. Furthermore, we show how this programming model can be built on top of a Big Data storage architecture, where the data stored in the backend is abstracted and accessed from the application in the form of persistent objects.},

	abstract = {The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one's analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one's analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

The rapidly increasing amounts of data available from the new high-throughput methods have made data processing infeasible without automated pipelines. The integration of data and analytic resources into workflow systems provides a solution to the problem by simplifying the task of data analysis. RESULTS: To address this challenge, we developed a cloud-based workflow management system, Closha, to provide fast and cost-effective analysis of massive genomic data. We implemented complex workflows making optimal use of high-performance computing clusters. Closha allows users to create multi-step analyses using drag and drop functionality and to modify the parameters of pipeline tools. Users can also import the Galaxy pipelines into Closha. Closha is a hybrid system that enables users to use both analysis programs providing traditional tools and MapReduce-based big data analysis programs simultaneously in a single pipeline. Thus, the execution of analytics algorithms can be parallelized, speeding up the whole process. We also developed a high-speed data transmission solution, KoDS, to transmit a large amount of data at a fast rate. KoDS has a file transfer speed of up to 10 times that of normal FTP and HTTP. The computer hardware for Closha is 660 CPU cores and 800 TB of disk storage, enabling 500 jobs to run at the same time. CONCLUSIONS: Closha is a scalable, cost-effective, and publicly available web service for large-scale genomic data analysis. Closha supports the reliable and highly scalable execution of sequencing analysis workflows in a fully automated manner. Closha provides a user-friendly interface to all genomic scientists to try to derive accurate results from NGS platform data. The Closha cloud server is freely available for use from http://closha.kobic.re.kr/ .},

Such "compact identifiers" have been widely used in biomedical informatics to support global resource identification with local identifier assignment. We report here on our project to provide robust support for machine-resolvable, persistent compact identifiers in biomedical data citation, by harmonizing the Identifiers.org and N2T.net (Name-To-Thing) meta-resolvers and extending their capabilities. Identifiers.org services hosted at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), and N2T.net services hosted at the California Digital Library (CDL), can now resolve any given identifier from over 600 source databases to its original source on the Web, using a common registry of prefix-based redirection rules.

	abstract = {Scientific experiments performed in the eScience domain require special tooling, software, and workflows that allow researchers to link, transform, visualize and interpret data. Recent studies report that such experiments often cannot be replicated due to dierences in the underlying infrastructure. The provenance collection mechanisms were built into workflow engines to increase research replicability. However, the traces do not contain the execution context that consists of software, hardware and external services used to produce the result which may change between executions. The problem thus remains on how to identify such context and how to store such data. To address this challenge we propose the context model that integrates ontologies which describe workflow and its environment. It includes not only high level description of workflow steps and services but also low level technical details on infrastructure, including hardware, software, and files. In this paper we discuss which ontologies that compose the context model must be instantiated to enable verification of a workflow re-execution. We use a tool that monitors a workflow execution and automatically creates the context model. We also authored the VPlan ontology that enables modelling validation requirements. It contains a controlled vocabulary of metrics that can be used for quantification of requirements. We evaluate the proposed ontologies on five Taverna workflows that dier in the degree on which they depend on additional software and services. The results show that the proposed ontologies are necessary and can be used for verification and validation of scientific workflows re-executions in dierent environments without the necessity of accessing the original environment at the same time. Thus the scientists can state whether the scientific experiment is replicable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of high-throughput experimental technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have led to new challenges for handling, analyzing and integrating the resulting large and diverse datasets. Bioinformatical analysis of these data commonly requires a number of mutually dependent steps applied to numerous samples for multiple conditions and replicates. To support these analyses, a number of workflow management systems (WMSs) have been developed to allow automated execution of corresponding analysis workflows. Major advantages of WMSs are the easy reproducibility of results as well as the reusability of workflows or their components. RESULTS: In this article, we present Watchdog, a WMS for the automated analysis of large-scale experimental data. Main features include straightforward processing of replicate data, support for distributed computer systems, customizable error detection and manual intervention into workflow execution. Watchdog is implemented in Java and thus platform-independent and allows easy sharing of workflows and corresponding program modules. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for workflow construction using pre-defined modules as well as a helper script for creating new module definitions. Execution of workflows is possible using either the GUI or a command-line interface and a web-interface is provided for monitoring the execution status and intervening in case of errors. To illustrate its potentials on a real-life example, a comprehensive workflow and modules for the analysis of RNA-seq experiments were implemented and are provided with the software in addition to simple test examples. CONCLUSIONS: Watchdog is a powerful and flexible WMS for the analysis of large-scale high-throughput experiments. We believe it will greatly benefit both users with and without programming skills who want to develop and apply bioinformatical workflows with reasonable overhead. The software, example workflows and a comprehensive documentation are freely available at www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/watchdog.},

Although such distribution of resources can lead to benefits, it also comes with its associated problems such as rampant duplication of file transfers increasing congestion, long job completion times, unexpected site crashing, suboptimal data transfer rates, unpredictable reliability in a time range, and suboptimal usage of storage elements. In addition, each sub-system becomes a potential failure node that can trigger system wide disruptions. In this vision paper, we outline our approach to leveraging Deep Learning algorithms to discover solutions to unique problems that arise in a system with computational infrastructure that is spread over a wide area. The presented vision, motivated by a real scientific use case from Belle II experiments, is to develop multilayer neural networks to tackle forecasting, anomaly detection and optimization challenges in a complex and distributed data movement environment. Through this vision based on Deep Learning principles, we aim to achieve reduced congestion events, faster file transfer rates, and enhanced site reliability.},

We use a representative, data-intensive bioinformatics workflow as a driving use case to showcase the above capabilities. Experimental results show that the Mobius++ framework, in conjunction with a novel virtual Software Defined Exchange (SDX) platform, is able to dynamically prioritize bandwidths between different end-points, on-demand, and being driven by priority directives from a workflow management system. We show that data transfer jobs from two workflows with different priorities are accurately arbitrated as the relative priorities change.},

	abstract = {Scientific datasets and the experiments that analyze them are growing in size and complexity, and scientists are facing difficulties to share such resources. Some initiatives have emerged to try to solve this problem. One of them involves the use of scientific workflows to represent and enact experiment execution. There is an increasing number of workflows that are potentially relevant for more than one scientific domain. However, it is hard to find workflows suitable for reuse given an experiment. Creating a workflow takes time and resources, and their reuse helps scientists to build new workflows faster and in a more reliable way. Search mechanisms in workflow repositories should provide different options for workflow discovery, but it is difficult for generic repositories to provide multiple mechanisms. This paper presents WorkflowHunt, a hybrid architecture for workflow search and discovery for generic repositories, which combines keyword and semantic search to allow finding relevant workflows using different search methods. We validated our architecture creating a prototype that uses real workflows and metadata from myExperiment, and compare search results via WorkflowHunt and via myExperiment's search interface.},

Over the last years, scientific workflows have been established as an important abstraction that captures data processing and computation of large and complex scientific applications. By allowing scientists to model and express entire data processing steps and their dependencies, workflow management systems relieve scientists from the details of an application and manage its execution on a computational infrastructure. As the resource requirements of today’s computational and data science applications that process vast amounts of data keep increasing, there is a compelling case for a new generation of advances in high-performance computing, commonly termed as extreme-scale computing, which will bring forth multiple challenges for the design of workflow applications and management systems. This paper presents a novel characterization of workflow management systems using features commonly associated with extreme-scale computing applications. We classify 15 popular workflow management systems in terms of workflow execution models, heterogeneous computing environments, and data access methods. The paper also surveys workflow applications and identifies gaps for future research on the road to extreme-scale workflows and management systems.},

Developing automated supportsystems for the collection, management and distribution of information is therefore animportant step to reduce error rates and accelerate progress to enable high-qualityresearch based on big data volumes. This thesis encompasses five articles, describingstrategies for the creation of technical research platforms, as well as descriptions of thetechnical platforms themselves.The key conclusion of the thesis is that technical solutions for many issues have beenavailable for a long time. These technical solutions are however overlooked, or simplyignored, if they fail to recognise the social dimensions of the issues they try to solve.The Molecular Methods database is an example of a technically sound but onlypartially successful solution in regards to social viability. Thousands of researchershave used the website to access protocols, but only a handful have shared their ownwork on MolMeth. Experiences from the Molecular Methods database and otherprojects have provided a foundation for studies supporting the development of theeB3KitThe eB3Kit is a portable, robust and scalable informatics platform for structured datamanagement. Deploying the platform enables research groups to carry out advancedresearch projects with very limited means. With the eB3Kit researchers can integratedata from a wide variety of sources, including the local laboratory informationmanagement system and analyse it using the Galaksio interface. Galaksio provides userfriendly access to the Galaxy workflow management system and provides eB3Kit userswith access to tools developed by a far larger user community than the one activelydeveloping the eB3Kit. Using a workflow management system improvesreproducibility and enables bioinformaticians to prepare workflows without directlyaccessing ethically or commercially sensitive data. Therefore, it is especially well-suited for applications where researchers are worried about privacy and during diseaseoutbreaks where persistent storage and analysis capacity must be established quickly.},

These are supported by a unique relational database to link applications with grid resources and presents those as workflow elements. A web portal facilitates its collaborative maintenance. The first approach implements a gateway service to handle authentication certificates and all communication with the grid. It reads the database to spawn web services for workflow elements which are in turn used by Taverna. The second approach lets Taverna communicate with the grid on its own, by means of a newly developed plug-in. It reads the database and executes the needed tasks directly on the grid. While the gateway service is non-intrusive, the plug-in has technical advantages, e.g. by allowing data to remain on the grid while being passed between workflow elements.

	abstract = {As whole genome sequencing becomes cheaper and faster, it will progressively substitute targeted next-generation sequencing as standard practice in research and diagnostics. However, computing cost-performance ratio is not advancing at an equivalent rate. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the robustness of the variant detection process taking into account the computing resources required. We have benchmarked six combinations of state-of-the-art read aligners (BWA-MEM and GEM3) and variant callers (FreeBayes, GATK HaplotypeCaller, SAMtools) on whole genome and whole exome sequencing data from the NA12878 human sample. Results have been compared between them and against the NIST Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) variants reference dataset. We report differences in speed of up to 20 times in some steps of the process and have observed that SNV, and to a lesser extent InDel, detection is highly consistent in 70\% of the genome. SNV, and especially InDel, detection is less reliable in 20\% of the genome, and almost unfeasible in the remaining 10\%. These findings will aid in choosing the appropriate tools bearing in mind objectives, workload, and computing infrastructure available. {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 The Authors. **Human Mutation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

RESULT: We present ImmunoNodes, an immunoinformatics toolbox that is fully integrated into the visual workflow environment KNIME. By dragging and dropping tools and connecting them to indicate the data flow through the pipeline, it is possible to construct very complex workflows without the need for coding.

	abstract = {Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data requires the processing of large datasets by chaining various tools with complex input and output formats. In order to automate data analysis, we propose to standardize NGS tasks into modular workflows. This simplifies reliable handling and processing of NGS data, and corresponding solutions become substantially more reproducible and easier to maintain. Here, we present a documented, linux-based, toolbox of 42 processing modules that are combined to construct workflows facilitating a variety of tasks such as DNAseq and RNAseq analysis. We also describe important technical extensions. The high throughput executor (HTE) helps to increase the reliability and to reduce manual interventions when processing complex datasets. We also provide a dedicated binary manager that assists users in obtaining the modules' executables and keeping them up to date. As basis for this actively developed toolbox we use the workflow management software KNIME.

	abstract = {Routine use of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) for forensic genomics is on the horizon. The last few years, several algorithms and workflows have been developed to analyze forensic MPS data. However, none have yet been tailored to the needs of the forensic analyst who does not possess an extensive bioinformatics background. We developed our previously published forensic MPS data analysis framework MyFLq (My-Forensic-Loci-queries) into an open-source, user-friendly, web-based application. It can be installed as a standalone web application, or run directly from the Illumina BaseSpace environment. In the former, laboratories can keep their data on-site, while in the latter, data from forensic samples that are sequenced on an Illumina sequencer can be uploaded to Basespace during acquisition, and can subsequently be analyzed using the published MyFLq BaseSpace application. Additional features were implemented such as an interactive graphical report of the results, an interactive threshold selection bar, and an allele length-based analysis in addition to the sequenced-based analysis. Practical use of the application is demonstrated through the analysis of four 16-plex short tandem repeat (STR) samples, showing the complementarity between the sequence- and length-based analysis of the same MPS data.

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of emerging genomics technologies and their application for assessing safety and efficacy of FDA-regulated products require a high standard of reliability and robustness supporting regulatory decision-making in the FDA. To facilitate the regulatory application, the FDA implemented a novel data submission program, Voluntary Genomics Data Submission (VGDS), and also to engage the stakeholders. As part of the endeavor, for the past 10 years, the FDA has led an international consortium of regulatory agencies, academia, pharmaceutical companies, and genomics platform providers, which was named MicroArray Quality Control Consortium (MAQC), to address issues such as reproducibility, precision, specificity/sensitivity, and data interpretation. Three projects have been completed so far assessing these genomics technologies: gene expression microarrays, whole genome genotyping arrays, and whole transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq). The resultant studies provide the basic parameters for fit-for-purpose application of these new data streams in regulatory environments, and the solutions have been made available to the public through peer-reviewed publications. The latest MAQC project is also called the SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC) project focused on next-generation sequencing. Using reference samples with built-in controls, SEQC studies have demonstrated that relative gene expression can be measured accurately and reliably across laboratories and RNA-seq platforms. Besides prediction performance comparable to microarrays in clinical settings and safety assessments, RNA-seq is shown to have better sensitivity for low expression and reveal novel transcriptomic features. Future effort of MAQC will be focused on quality control of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational bioinformatics workflows are extensively used to analyse genomics data, with different approaches available to support implementation and execution of these workflows. Reproducibility is one of the core principles for any scientific workflow and remains a challenge, which is not fully addressed. This is due to incomplete understanding of reproducibility requirements and assumptions of workflow definition approaches. Provenance information should be tracked and used to capture all these requirements supporting reusability of existing workflows. RESULTS: We have implemented a complex but widely deployed bioinformatics workflow using three representative approaches to workflow definition and execution. Through implementation, we identified assumptions implicit in these approaches that ultimately produce insufficient documentation of workflow requirements resulting in failed execution of the workflow. This study proposes a set of recommendations that aims to mitigate these assumptions and guides the scientific community to accomplish reproducible science, hence addressing reproducibility crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Reproducing, adapting or even repeating a bioinformatics workflow in any environment requires substantial technical knowledge of the workflow execution environment, resolving analysis assumptions and rigorous compliance with reproducibility requirements. Towards these goals, we propose conclusive recommendations that along with an explicit declaration of workflow specification would result in enhanced reproducibility of computational genomic analyses.},

Butler operates equally well on public and academic clouds. This highly flexible framework facilitates management of virtual cloud infrastructure, software configuration, genomics workflow development, and provides unique capabilities in workflow execution management. By comprehensively collecting and analysing metrics and logs, performing anomaly detection as well as notification and cluster self-healing, Butler enables large-scale analytical processing of human genomes with 43\% increased throughput compared to prior setups. Butler was key for delivering the germline genetic variant call-sets in 2,834 cancer genomes analysed by PCAWG.},

Faced with the complexity of analysis pipelines, the large number of computational tools, and the enormous amount of data to manage, there is compelling evidence that many if not most scientific discoveries will not stand the test of time: increasing the reproducibility of computed results is of paramount importance. The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of repro-ducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences. Our study was guided by three use cases from the life science domain involving in silico experiments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational biology comprises a wide range of technologies and approaches. Multiple technologies can be combined to create more powerful workflows if the individuals contributing the data or providing tools for its interpretation can find mutual understanding and consensus. Much conversation and joint investigation are required in order to identify and implement the best approaches. Traditionally, scientific conferences feature talks presenting novel technologies or insights, followed up by informal discussions during coffee breaks. In multi-institution collaborations, in order to reach agreement on implementation details or to transfer deeper insights in a technology and practical skills, a representative of one group typically visits the other. However, this does not scale well when the number of technologies or research groups is large. Conferences have responded to this issue by introducing Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, which offer an opportunity for individuals with common interests to intensify their interaction. However, parallel BoF sessions often make it hard for participants to join multiple BoFs and find common ground between the different technologies, and BoFs are generally too short to allow time for participants to program together. RESULTS: This report summarises our experience with computational biology Codefests, Hackathons and Sprints, which are interactive developer meetings. They are structured to reduce the limitations of traditional scientific meetings described above by strengthening the interaction among peers and letting the participants determine the schedule and topics. These meetings are commonly run as loosely scheduled "unconferences" (self-organized identification of participants and topics for meetings) over at least two days, with early introductory talks to welcome and organize contributors, followed by intensive collaborative coding sessions. We summarise some prominent achievements of those meetings and describe differences in how these are organised, how their audience is addressed, and their outreach to their respective communities. CONCLUSIONS: Hackathons, Codefests and Sprints share a stimulating atmosphere that encourages participants to jointly brainstorm and tackle problems of shared interest in a self-driven proactive environment, as well as providing an opportunity for new participants to get involved in collaborative projects.},

	abstract = {As genomic datasets continue to grow, the feasibility of downloading data to a local organization and running analysis on a traditional compute environment is becoming increasingly problematic. Current large-scale projects, such as the ICGC PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG), the Data Platform for the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative, and the NIH Big Data to Knowledge Center for Translational Genomics, are using cloud-based infrastructure to both host and perform analysis across large data sets. In PCAWG, over 5,800 whole human genomes were aligned and variant called across 14 cloud and HPC environments; the processed data was then made available on the cloud for further analysis and sharing. If run locally, an operation at this scale would have monopolized a typical academic data centre for many months, and would have presented major challenges for data storage and distribution. However, this scale is increasingly typical for genomics projects and necessitates a rethink of how analytical tools are packaged and moved to the data. For PCAWG, we embraced the use of highly portable Docker images for encapsulating and sharing complex alignment and variant calling workflows across highly variable environments. While successful, this endeavor revealed a limitation in Docker containers, namely the lack of a standardized way to describe and execute the tools encapsulated inside the container. As a result, we created the Dockstore ( https://dockstore.org), a project that brings together Docker images with standardized, machine-readable ways of describing and running the tools contained within. This service greatly improves the sharing and reuse of genomics tools and promotes interoperability with similar projects through emerging web service standards developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).},

The ease of deployment and the process isolation they enable, as well as the reproducibility they permit across environments and versions, are among the qualities that make them interesting candidates for the construction of bioinformatic infrastructures, at any scale from single workstations to high throughput computing architectures. The Docker Hub is a public registry which can be used to distribute bioinformatic software as Docker images. However, its lack of curation and its genericity make it difﬁcult for a bioinformatics user to ﬁnd the most appropriate images needed. BioShaDock is a bioinformatics-focused Docker registry, which provides a local and fully controlled environment to build and publish bioinformatic software as portable Docker images. It provides a number of improvements over the base Docker registry on authentication and permissions management, that enable its integration in existing bioinformatic infrastructures such as computing platforms. The metadata associated with the registered images are domain-centric, including for instance concepts deﬁned in the EDAM ontology, a shared and structured vocabulary of commonly used terms in bioinformatics. The registry also includes user deﬁned tags to facilitate its discovery, as well as a link to the tool description in the ELIXIR registry if it already exists. If it does not, the BioShaDock registry will synchronize with the registry to create a new description in the Elixir registry, based on the BioShaDock entry metadata. This link will help users get more information on the tool such as its EDAM operations, input and output types. This allows integration with the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry, thus providing the appropriate visibility of such images to the bioinformatics community.},

One such specification is the Common Workflow Language, an emerging standard which provides a robust and flexible framework for describing data analysis tools and workflows. In addition, reproducibility can be furthered by executors or workflow engines which interpret the specification and enable additional features, such as error logging, file organization, optim1izations to computation and job scheduling, and allow for easy computing on large volumes of data.

We note that the use of the Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering of Azure can represent a steep learning curve for bioinformatics developers who will usually have a Linux and scripting language background. On the other hand, the presence of an additional set of libraries makes it easier to deploy software in a parallel (scalable) fashion and explicitly manage such a production run with only a few hundred lines of code, most of which can be incorporated from a template.

We therefore created a directory of useful decoys (DUD) by selecting decoys that resembled annotated ligands physically but not topologically to benchmark docking performance. DUD has 2950 annotated ligands and 95,316 property-matched decoys for 40 targets. It is by far the largest and most comprehensive public data set for benchmarking virtual screening programs that I am aware of. This paper outlines several ways that DUD can be improved to provide better telemetry to investigators seeking to understand both the strengths and the weaknesses of current docking methods. I also highlight several pitfalls for the unwary: a risk of over-optimization, questions about chemical space, and the proper scope for using DUD. Careful attention to both the composition of benchmarks and how they are used is essential to avoid being misled by overfitting and bias.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Open Source movement and its technologies are popular in the bioinformatics community because they provide freely available tools and resources for research. In order to feed the steady demand for updates on software and associated data, a service infrastructure is required for sharing and providing these tools to heterogeneous computing environments. RESULTS: The Debian Med initiative provides ready and coherent software packages for medical informatics and bioinformatics. These packages can be used together in Taverna workflows via the UseCase plugin to manage execution on local or remote machines. If such packages are available in cloud computing environments, the underlying hardware and the analysis pipelines can be shared along with the software. CONCLUSIONS: Debian Med closes the gap between developers and users. It provides a simple method for offering new releases of software and data resources, thus provisioning a local infrastructure for computational biology. For geographically distributed teams it can ensure they are working on the same versions of tools, in the same conditions. This contributes to the world-wide networking of researchers.},

Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2016.

In support of these discoveries, a plethora of databases and tools are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.Here we present a community-driven curation effort, supported by ELIXIR-the European infrastructure for biological information-that aspires to a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources. The sustainable upkeep of this Tools and Data Services Registry is assured by a curation effort driven by and tailored to local needs, and shared amongst a network of engaged partners.As of November 2015, the registry includes 1785 resources, with depositions from 126 individual registrations including 52 institutional providers and 74 individuals. With community support, the registry can become a standard for dissemination of information about bioinformatics resources: we welcome everyone to join us in this common endeavour.

Workflow systems can be useful to simplify construction of analysis pipelines that automate tasks, support reproducibility and provide measures for fault-tolerance. However, workflow systems can incur significant development and administration overhead so bioinformatics pipelines are often still built without them. We present the experiences with workflows and workflow systems within the bioinformatics community participating in a series of hackathons and workshops of the EU COST action SeqAhead. The organizations are working on similar problems, but we have addressed them with different strategies and solutions. This fragmentation of efforts is inefficient and leads to redundant and incompatible solutions.

Here we present methods to make high-confidence, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel and homozygous reference genotype calls for NA12878, the pilot genome for the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. We minimize bias toward any method by integrating and arbitrating between 14 data sets from five sequencing technologies, seven read mappers and three variant callers. We identify regions for which no confident genotype call could be made, and classify them into different categories based on reasons for uncertainty.

Reusing and re-purposing workflows allow scientists to do new experiments faster, since the workflows capture useful expertise from others. As workflow libraries grow, scientists face the challenge of finding workflows appropriate for their task, understanding what each workflow does, and reusing relevant portions of a given workflow. We believe that workflows would be easier to understand and reuse if high-level views (abstractions) of their activities were available in workflow libraries. As a first step towards obtaining these abstractions, we report in this paper on the results of a manual analysis performed over a set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna, Wings, Galaxy and Vistrails. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflow motifs that outline (i) the kinds of data-intensive activities that are observed in workflows (Data-Operation motifs), and (ii) the different manners in which activities are implemented within workflows (Workflow-Oriented motifs). These motifs are helpful to identify the functionality of the steps in a given workflow, to develop best practices for workflow design, and to develop approaches for automated generation of workflow abstractions.},

	abstract = {A central tenet in support of research reproducibility is the ability to uniquely identify research resources, i.e., reagents, tools, and materials that are used to perform experiments. However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to allow humans and algorithms to identify the exact resources that are reported or answer basic questions such as "What other studies used resource X?" To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the methods sections of papers and thereby improve identifiability and reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their manuscripts prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (including software and databases). RRIDs represent accession numbers assigned by an authoritative database, e.g., the model organism databases, for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central web portal ( www.scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 papers have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40. Here, we present an overview of the pilot project and its outcomes to date. We show that authors are generally accurate in performing the task of identifying resources and supportive of the goals of the project. We also show that identifiability of the resources pre- and post-pilot showed a dramatic improvement for all three resource types, suggesting that the project has had a significant impact on reproducibility relating to research resources.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a formal semantics for the Taverna 2 scientific workflow system. Taverna 2 is a successor to Taverna, an open-source workflow system broadly adopted within the e-science community worldwide. The new version improves upon the existing model in two main ways: (i) by adding support for data pipelining, which in turns enables input streams of indefinite length to be processed efficiently; and (ii) by providing new extensibility points that make it possible to add new operators to the workflow model. Consistent with previous work by some of the authors, we use trace semantics to describe the effect of workflow computations, and we show how they can be used to describe the new features in the Taverna 2 model.},

Still, a number of specific conditions on this domain greatly hinders these developments, including ethical and legal issues, fragmentation of the relevant data in different locations, and a level of (meta)data complexity that requires great expertise across technical, clinical, and biological domains. We propose the Patient Dossier paradigm as a way to organize new innovative healthcare services that sorts the current limitations. The Patient Dossier conceptual framework identifies the different issues and suggests how they can be tackled in a safe, efficient, and responsible way while opening options for independent development for different players in the healthcare sector. An initial implementation of the Patient Dossier concepts in the Rbbt framework is available as open-source at https://github.com/mikisvaz and https://github.com/Rbbt-Workflows.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04497v1},
	abstract = {Particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) can generically have lifetimes that
are long compared to SM particles at the weak scale. When produced at
experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived
particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary
proton-proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of
promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for
new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for
example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical
properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a
comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure
that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here
we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists
with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments --- as well as those working on
dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and FASER
--- to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path
for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3
and at the High-Luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and
future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new
LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that
give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We
develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches;
document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of
proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of
search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity
"dark showers", highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for
these signals.},
